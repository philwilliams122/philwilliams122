### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil, a data enthusiast with a passion for leveraging the power of data to drive meaningful insights and make informed decisions. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸ“š With a foundation in business administration and an MBA, I bring a unique blend of business acumen and analytical skills to the table. My educational journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of organisational dynamics and strategic thinking, which I now apply in the realm of data science.

ðŸ’» Currently, I am on a path of growth and knowledge as I complete HyperionDev's Data Science Bootcamp. This experience has allowed me to immerse myself in the world of data. specifically, I have gained experience with Python, machine learning concepts, sci-kit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and git.

ðŸš€ On my GitHub, you'll find a few projects and code repositories that reflect my journey as a data scientist. I am looking for opportunities to enhance my skills, collaborate with fellow data enthusiasts, and contribute to open-source projects that drive positive change.

ðŸ’¡ Beyond data science, I am a lifelong learner who enjoys staying updated with the latest technological advancements and industry trends. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to broaden my knowledge through reading, attending workshops, and engaging in online communities.
